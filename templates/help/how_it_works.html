    <h1>How it Works</h1>
    <p><i class="fa-regular fa-file-pdf text-success my-1"></i>&nbsp;<strong>pub2sum</strong> employs different
        technologies which are introduced here briefly.</p>
    <p><strong>Summarization</strong><br>
        The <a href="https://layout-parser.github.io/" target="_blank">Layout Parser</a> library provides a pipeline of
        Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to filter out the text of a paper. This text is then split into
        chunks and fed to the <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI API</a> for summarization. After one round the algorithm checks if the resulting
        summaries are still too long for GPT-3 to process in one request. If not, the text is split again into chunks
        and summarized. This process is repeated until only one chunk of text is left, which is used for a last request
        to obtain the final summary of the paper.</p>
    <p><strong>Fetching references</strong><br>
        First, the <a href="https://github.com/MicheleCotrufo/pdf2doi" target="_blank">pdf2doi</a> library is used to obtain the DOI of the paper. This identifier is then used to fetch the
        relevant metadata of the scientific paper via API calls. The response is formatted into three references. The
        first reference in the text, the continuing reference, and the reference list entry.
